# Track_Initiation_Algorithm: uses Hough Transform for the track initiation algorithm.
Using Matlab GUI and m-function for this work: GUI_Track_initiation.fig, GUI_Track_initiation.m, track_initiation.m
Slides: The track initiation algorithm based on Hough Transform.pptx
Uses 4 Radar image frames for track initiation.
